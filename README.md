# Laravel-Catering-Site
I have migrated the catering site to utilize the laravel framework.

If you want to use these files and have a laravel project open you would need to:<br>
Place the web pages in the [views folder] inside the [resources folder].<br>
Place the routes file in the [routes folder].<br>
Place the CSS, JS, imgs and menu pdfs in the [public folder].

The files included on here are:
1. Web Pages
2. Routes File
3. CSS Files
4. Javascript Files
5. Menu PDFs
6. Image Folder (is not included due personal pictures used [may add some stock photos in future])
